# nBodySim

This simulates many bodies under the effect of gravity. Requires numpy and pygame.

w, a, s, and d move the screen.

z outputs memory usage stats, x clears the paths of the particles, and c deletes all the objects on screen.

spacebar pauses the simulation.

to create a new particle, click and drag to determine the size of the particle; the area of the circle is the square root of the mass.

to determine the velocity of the particle, click in the direction from which the particle would have come from; press spacebar to give it zero speed.

press q while creating to prevent the particle from changing speed beyond the initial assignment.
